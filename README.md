## Developers

This site uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/). Make sure you have those installed via the `gem` package manager.

1. Change directory to `styles/scss` and run `bourbon install`

2. Change directory to `styles` and run `sass --watch scss:css`

3. Make sure to only edit `*.scss` files in `styles/scss` as `sass` will convert `*.scss` to `*.css` in `styles/css`
